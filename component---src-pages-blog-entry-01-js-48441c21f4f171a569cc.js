For different reasons, I had to do 2 movings during this year 2020, both during the pandemic and between quite affected countries. And I still survived!

Multiple visits at a time might not be allowed, and be prepared to do show-rooms via Skype/zoom/webex/… for those who are interested but cannot attend in-person visits.
